# Production Test Report - Movies Tracker App

**Date:** February 2, 2026
**Production URL:** https://movies-tracker-app-tawny.vercel.app

## Summary

The application is now fully functional in production. Initial testing revealed a critical 500 error that has been resolved.

## Issues Found & Resolved

1. **Critical: 500 Internal Server Error on Home Page**
   - **Cause:** The `TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable on Vercel contained an invalid character (newline), causing the `fetch` header to fail.
   - **Fix:**
     - Modified `src/lib/tmdb.ts` to use `.trim()` on the access token for robustness.
     - Corrected the environment variable on Vercel using `vercel env add`.
2. **Build Error: Metadata Type Error**
   - **Cause:** `src/app/layout.tsx` used `icon` instead of `icons` in the `Metadata` object.
   - **Fix:** Updated the metadata structure to match Next.js standards.

## Recommendations

- **Post-Deploy Monitoring:** Monitor Vercel logs for any persistent 500 errors.
- **Environment Variable Validation:** Ensure all sensitive tokens are pasted without extra whitespace or newlines.
- **Database Cleanup:** Remove any test users created during this verification process if needed.
